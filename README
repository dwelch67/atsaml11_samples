So the cortex-m22 parts are now available.

At the moment binutils/gcc have not caught up so hopefully wont get
stuck with undefined instructions.

I started with the SAML10_FP32.kicad_pcb and each of these parts.

Note I am in no way claiming to be a pro board designer, this is
on the very edge of minimal, it does happen to work for me.

Have some SSOP parts will build a board for those next.
