These examples are specific to the

ATSAML10E16A-AU

for now, will try the SSOP soon.

So far there is little to no support for this part or the cortex-m23

I found that openocd 0.10.0 with the configs that work on other
cortex-ms didnt work, but openocd 0.9.0 does.


openocd -f jlink.cfg -f target.cfg


telnet localhost 4444

halt
load_image blinker01/blinker01.sram.elf
resume 0x20000000


halt
load_image flash01/flash01.sram.elf
resume 0x20000000
